## From inside a Handler 

From the context of a Handler further Handler execution can be aborted by calling the `IBus.DoNotContinueDispatchingCurrentMessageToHandlers()` method. This method instruct the bus not to pass the current message on to subsequent handlers in the pipeline. This is often used by authentication and authorization handlers when those checks fail.

<!-- import AbortHandler-->

Warning: Handler execution order is non-deterministic. If you require the handler that aborts the pipeline to run first then you may want to configure the [Handler Ordering](/nservicebus/handlers/handler-ordering.md).

## Via a pipeline Behavior

The pipeline can also be aborted by injecting a custom Behavior that, with some custom logic, optionally decides to abort Behaviors nested inside it. 

<!-- import AbortPipelineWithBehavior--> 

For more information about creating and where to inject a behavior see [customizing the pipeline](/nservicebus/pipeline/customizing.md).
