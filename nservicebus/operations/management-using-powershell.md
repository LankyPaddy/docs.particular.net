Particular provides a PowerShell Module to make it easy to setup a computer to run NServiceBus.

# NServiceBus PowerShell 5.0

This is the latest release of the PowerShell module.   

## Prerequisites

Prior to installation ensure that PowerShell V2 or greater is installed. 

Earlier versions of the NServiceBus.PowerShell module required .NET 4. In V5.0 the module is compatible with .NET 2 so there is no longer a requirement to upgrade PowerShell to version V3.0+ or modify the `Powershell.exe.config` to force .NET 4 to be used.

## Installation

The installation file for the module can be found [here](https://github.com/particular/NServicebus.Powershell/releases/latest)

## Usage

After installation the module can be loaded into a PowerShell session by issuing the following command:

	Import-Module NServiceBus.PowerShell

The installation adds the NServiceBus.PowerShell module location to the `PSModulePath` environment variable. If the module isn't available you may need to restart your Windows session for this change to to take effect.

## Help  
  
A list of available commandlet can be found by issuing the following PowerShell command

	Get-Command -Module NServiceBus.PowerShell

Help for each commandlet incorporated within the module and can be accessed via the standard [PowerShell Get-Help Command](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176848.aspx). For example `Get-Help Set-NServiceBusLocalMachineSettings` returns the following information

	NAME
	    Set-NServiceBusLocalMachineSettings
    
	SYNOPSIS
	    Sets the default Error and Audit queues.
    
    
	SYNTAX
	    Set-NServiceBusLocalMachineSettings [-ErrorQueue <String>] [-AuditQueue <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
	DESCRIPTION
	    Sets the registry settings for the default audit and error queues.  
        These settings can be found in the registry under "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ParticularSoftware\ServiceBus".  
		On 64 bit operating system the settings are applied to both the 32-bit and 64-bit registry.
 
## Upgrade information

### RavenDB commandlet

NServiceBus now supports multiple versions of the [RavenDB](/nservicebus/ravendb/version-compatibility.md) client.  Previous versions of the PowerShell module included cmdlets to install and test  RavenDB V2.0.2375. To avoid confusion we have removed these cmdlets in V5.0:

	Install-NServiceBusRavenDB
	Test-NServiceBusRavenDBInstallation

For RavenDB installation instructions please review [Installing RavenDB](/nservicebus/ravendb/installation.md) 

### Licensing 
   
Version 5 of the PowerShell module includes a commandlet for importing a Particular Platform License. This will work for NServiceBus versions 4. If you which to to install a license for versions prior to NServiceBus v4.5 then an alternative method should be used. See  [License Management](/nservicebus/licensing/license-management.md) for

and then use the commandlet you want. 

NOTE: there will be less feedback from the script if you run the commandlet inside Visual Studio. If you get warnings it might be a good idea to run the commandlet from a real PowerShell Console.

    PS> Import-Module .\NServiceBus.Powershell.dll

Or you can follow the instructions to load them into your [PowerShell profile.](http://www.howtogeek.com/50236/customizing-your-powershell-profile/)

# Known Issues with V3 and V4

If you are getting the following error:

```
Import-Module : Could not load file or assembly
'file:///C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Particular Software\\NServiceBus\\v4.0\\NServiceBus\\Binaries\\NServiceBus.PowerShell.dll' or one of its dependencies. This assembly is built by a runtime newer than the currently loaded runtime and cannot be loaded. 
```

Although it is possible to change the existing version of `Powershell.exe.config` to load .NET 4.0 framework, the preferred approach is to install PowerShell 3 than to change the configuration files. Forcing PowerShell 2 to use .NET 4 can break PS Snapins from other vendors. PowerShell 3 provides a command line option to switch versions of PS and .NET if needed.
