## Move to .NET 4.5.1

In Version 6 the new minimum .NET version for NServiceBus is .NET 4.5.1.

**This means consumers need to update all projects (that reference NServiceBus) to be .NET 4.5.1 before updating to NServiceBus version 6. **

In the interest of "smaller changes are easier to verify" it is recommended that you do the update to .NET 4.5.1, and full migration to production, before updating to NServiceBus version 6.


## Header management


### Setting headers on outgoing messages

Headers are now set using the new `Send`/`Reply` or `Publish` options. `Bus.SetMessageHeader` is no longer available.

Full documentation on how to manage headers can be found [here](/nservicebus/messaging/message-headers.md).


### Setting outgoing headers for the entire endpoint

NServiceBus allows you to set headers that are applied to all outgoing messages for the entire endpoint. In version 6 you now do this using:

<!-- import 5to6header-static-endpoint -->


### Setting headers on the outgoing pipeline

Headers can now be set using `context.SetHeader` like show below

<!-- import 5to6header-outgoing-behavior -->

Also note that headers are "set" only on the outgoing pipeline.


## Using a custom correlation id

Custom [correlation Id's](/nservicebus/messaging/message-correlation.md) for outgoing messages should now be set using the new `Send`/`Reply` or `Publish` options instead of being passed into `bus.Send`


## Message mutators

The `IMessageMutator` and `IMutateTransportMessages` interfaces are no longer available. Instead you should just use the individual `IMutateOutgoingMessages`, `IMutateIncomingMessages`, `IMutateIncomingTransportMessages` and `IMutateOutgoingTransportMessages` as needed since they provide the same functionality.


### New context arguments

The signature for the mutators now pass context arguments that gives you access to relevant information on the message and also giving you ways to mutate the message. This context will give you access to the same functionality as previous versions so just update your code accordingly.

See [header management](/nservicebus/messaging/message-headers.md) for one example on how this might look.


## Visual Studio PowerShell helpers removed  

In version 3 of NServiceBus a feature was added to the nuget package that allowed consumers to generate xml configurations sections using the PowerShell console in Visual Studio. For example `Add-NServiceBusAuditConfig ProjectName` would result in the following being added to the app.config.

```
<configuration>
  <configSections>
    <section name="AuditConfig" type="NServiceBus.Config.AuditConfig, NServiceBus.Core" />
  </configSections>
  <AuditConfig QueueName="audit" />
</configuration>
```

In Version 6 these helpers have been removed for several reasons.


### Discoverability

These helpers are no more discoverable than using documentation or samples. If you need to read documentation to discover the commandlet you can just as copy the documentation on how to configure it.


### Code based configuration

In Version 6 we are improving the code based configuration story. For example you can now configure both [Error](/nservicebus/errors/#configure-your-error-queue-using-code) and [Audit](/nservicebus/operations/auditing.md#configuring-auditing-using-code) queues via the code API. This approach is more versatile since you can now read you configuration from any location at runtime.


### They are a crutch that enabled complex configuration

Configuration should be easy to apply to your code and easy to manipulate by hand. Unfortunately the configuration helpers enabled more complex xml configuration by allowing people to take the stance of "it is OK this is complex to configure since the xml can be generated". This is not a scenario we want to enable moving forward.


## Timeouts


### Timeout storage

`IPersistTimeouts` has been split into two interfaces, `IPersistTimeouts` and `IQueryTimeouts`, to properly separate those storage concerns. Both must be implemented to have a fully functional timeout infrastructure. 

`IQueryTimeouts` implements the concern of polling for timeouts outside the context of a message pipeline. `IPersistTimeouts` implements the concern of storage and removal for timeouts which is executed inside the context of a pipeline. Depending on the design of the timeout persisters, those concerns can now be implemented independently. Furthermore, `IPersistTimeouts` introduced a new parameter `TimeoutPersistenceOptions `. This parameter allows access to the pipeline context. This enables timeout persisters to manipulate everything that exists in the context during message pipeline execution.


## Sagas


### Unique attribute no longer needed

NServiceBus will automatically make correlated saga properties unique without the need for a explicit `[Unique]` attribute to be used. You can safely remove the attribute from your saga data types.


### Saga persisters & finders

Saga persisters (`ISagaPersister`) and finders (`IFindSagas`) introduce a new parameter `SagaPersistenceOptions`. This parameter gives access to the saga metadata and pipeline context. This enables  persisters and finders to manipulate everything that exists in the context during message pipeline execution. For more information see [Sagas](/nservicebus/sagas/) and [Complex saga finding logic](/nservicebus/sagas/saga-finding.md).


## Outbox


### Outbox storage

`IOutboxStorage` introduced a new parameter `OutboxStorageOptions`. This parameter gives access to the pipeline context. This enables outbox storage methods to manipulate everything that exists in the context during message pipeline execution.


## Subscriptions


### Subscription storage

`ISubscriptionStorage` has been split into three interfaces, `ISubscriptionStorage`, `IInitializableSubscriptionStorage` and `IQuerySubscriptions`, to properly separate those storage concerns. `ISubscriptionStorage` and `IQuerySubscriptions` must be implemented to have a fully functional subscription infrastructure. `IInitializableSubscriptionStorage` is only necessary when the subscription storage needs to be initialized.

`IQuerySubscriptions` implements the concern of retrieving subscriptions outside the context of a message pipeline. `ISubscriptionStorage` implements the concern of storage and removal for subscriptions, which is executed inside the context of a pipeline. Depending on the design of the subscription storage, those concerns can now be implemented independently. Furthermore, `ISubscriptionStorage` introduced a new parameter `SubscriptionStorageOptions`. This parameter allows access to the pipeline context. This enables subscription storages to manipulate everything that exists in the context during message pipeline execution.


## MSMQ ReturnToSourceQueue.exe

The MSMQ ReturnToSourceQueue.exe tool is now deprecated. The code for this tool has been moved to [ParticularLabs/MsmqReturnToSourceQueue](https://github.com/ParticularLabs/MsmqReturnToSourceQueue) repository. See the readme in that repository for full details.


## Handling responses on the client side

We've separated the callback support from the NServiceBus core. This means that you now have to explicitly install our new [NServiceBus.Callbacks](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Callbacks/) to get access to callback support. In contrast to previous versions this API allows you to easily access the response message and is asynchronous by default.

The differences in the API are fully covered in [handling responses on the client side](/nservicebus/messaging/handling-responses-on-the-client-side.md).


## Message handler ordering

In Version 6 we simplified the message handler ordering APIs. Previously there were multiple ways to specify the handler ordering:

* Using a code only approach with `config.LoadMessageHandlers(First<H1>.Then<H2>().AndThen<H3>().AndThen<H4>())`
* By implementing `ISpecifyMessageHandlerOrdering` and either using `order.SpecifyFirst<H1>` or `order.Specify(First<H1>.Then<H2>())`

The unified approach can be accessed by either using `config.ExecuteTheseHandlersFirst(params Type[] handlerTypes)` or `config.ExecuteTheseHandlersFirst(IEnumerable<Type> handlerTypes)` on the `BusConfiguration` instance.

The full API can be seen in [Handler ordering](/nservicebus/handlers/handler-ordering.md).


## Accessing the builder outside the NServiceBus infrastructure

When you wanted to use the `IBuilder` interface outside the infrastructure of NServiceBus it was possible to use a hack by casting the `IBus` interface to `UnicastBus` and then accessing the `Builder` property like this:

`var builder = ((UnicastBus)bus).Builder`

This is no longer supported. We advise to, instead of using `IBuilder` directly, use dependency injection via your container of choice.

## AutoSubscribe

The configuration option `DoNotRequireExplicitRouting()` has been obsoleted since transports with support for centralized pubsub will always auto subscribe all events without requiring explicit routing. Transports with message driven pubsub (like MSMQ, SqlServer and AzureStorageQueues) will not subscribe properly if there is no routing specified. If you used this option you can safely be removed it.

## Queue creation

The interface `IWantQueueCreated` has been replaced by the `QueueBindings` class. There is a singleton `QueueBindings` object available via the settings API (`ReadOnlySettings` interface). The following snippet shows the difference when trying to register a queue for creation.

<!-- import 5to6queuebindings -->
