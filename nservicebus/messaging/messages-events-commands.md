A Message is the unit of communication for NServiceBus. There are two sub-types of messages that capture more of the intent and help NServiceBus enforce messaging best practices. This enforcement is enabled by default unless disabled in configuration [configuration](configure-best-practice-enforcement.md). 

### Command

Used to request that an action should be taken. Characteristics include

-   Are not allowed to be published since all commands should have one logical owner and should be sent to the endpoint responsible for processing
-   Cannot be subscribed and unsubscribed to
-   Cannot implement `IEvent`

### Event

Used to communicate that some action has taken place. Characteristics include

-   Can be published
-   Can be subscribed and unsubscribed to
-   Cannot be sent using Bus.Send() since all events should be published
-   Cannot implement `ICommand`
-   Cannot be sent using the gateway, i.e., `bus.SendToSites()`

Note: For reply messages in a request and response pattern, you may want to use `IMessage` since these replies are neither a Command or an Event.

## Defining Messages

Messages can be defined via two mechanisms

### Marker interfaces

The simplest way to define a message is to use a marker interfaces. 

 * `NServiceBus.IMessage` for defining a Message
 * `NServiceBus.ICommand` for defining a Command
 * `NServiceBus.IEvent` for defining an Event


```C#
public class MyMessage : IMessage { }

public class MyComman : ICommand { }

public class MyEvent : IEvent { }
public interface MyEvent : IEvent { }
```

### Conventions 

Message Conventions is a way of defining what classes are Messages/Events or commands without the use of interfaces.



Note: It is important to include the `.Namespace != null`; otherwise a null reference exception will occur during the type scanning.

When Message Conventions are combined with avoiding an reference to any NServiceBus assemblies this is referred to as [Unobtrusive Mode](unobtrusive-mode.md)
