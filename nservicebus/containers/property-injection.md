When using the NServiceBus built-in container it is possible to control property injection.

So given the following class that is constructed by the container.

<!-- import PropertyInjectionWithHandler --> 

The inject property values you could do the following:

<!-- import ConfigurePropertyInjectionForHandlerBefore --> 

At construction time both `SmtpAddress` and `SmtpPort` will be injected.

## A Handler/Saga specific API

From v5.2 and above a new, more explicit, API has been introduced that specifically targets Handlers and Sagas.

<!-- import ConfigurePropertyInjectionForHandler -->
