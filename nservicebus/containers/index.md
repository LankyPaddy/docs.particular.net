NServiceBus relies heavily on Containers and Dependency Injection to manage services and state.

NServiceBus automatically registers all its components as well as user-implemented handlers and sagas so that all instancing modes and wiring are done correctly by default and without errors.

NServiceBus has a built-in container (currently an ILMerged version of Autofac) but it can be replaced by any other container.

## Getting other containers

Other containers are available on NuGet.

- http://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Autofac/
- http://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Ninject/
- http://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.CastleWindsor/
- http://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.StructureMap/
- http://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Spring/
- http://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Unity/

## Configuring NServiceBus to use other containers

The following code demonstrates how to configure NServiceBus to use a container of your choosing. Each assumes you've already included the relevant NuGet package above.

<!-- import Containers --> 

## Plugging in your own container

If you have your own container that is not already supported by a NuGet package, you can create a plugin centering around the `IContainer` abstraction. Once this is created and registered, NServiceBus will use your custom container to look up its own dependencies.

<!-- import CustomContainers -->
