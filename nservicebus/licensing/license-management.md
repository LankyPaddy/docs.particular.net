## Overview

There are several ways to make sure that your NServiceBus endpoints pick up and use your license. 

## Using the Registry

### NServiceBus 4.5 and above

The standalone NServiceBus PowerShell V5.0 includes a commandlet for importing the Platform License into the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` registry. See [Managing Using PowerShell](/nservicebus/operations/management-using-powershell.md) for more details and installation instructions for the PowerShell Module.

On a 64 bit OS the license will be imported into both the For 64-bit operating systems the license is written to both the 32-bit and 64-bit registry.  The license is stored is `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\ParticularSoftware\\License`. 

#### Advanced Registry Options

These following instructions cover installing the license file without using NServiceBus PowerShell Module.  These options give a bit more flexibility as they allow you to store the the license in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` if you wish.  IF the licenses is stored in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` it is only accessible to the current user.   

##### Using Regedit.exe  

- Open the `Regedit.exe` tool 
- Goto `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\ParticularSoftware` or `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\ParticularSoftware` 
- Create a `REG_MULTI_SZ` value called `License` 
- Paste the contents of the license file you've received from Particular software. 

##### Using PowerShell Script  

* Open an administrative PowerShell prompt.
* Change the current working directory to where your license.xml file is.
* Run the following script 

```
$content = Get-Content license.xml | Out-String
Set-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\Software\ParticularSoftware -Name License -Force -Value $content
```
NOTE: On a 64 bit operating system this script should not be run through the PowerShell(x86) console prompt, doing so will result in the license being imported into the 32 registry key. Please use a 64bit PowerShell session. 

NOTE: As of version 4.5, both the `LicenseInstaller.exe` tool and the `install-NServiceBusLicense` PowerShell commandlet has been deprecated. 

### NServiceBus 3.3

NServiceBus V3.3 supports storing the license in a registry key called `[HKEYCURRENTUSER\\Software\\NServiceBus\\{Major.Minor}\\License]`.

To install the license in the registry, use one of these options:

-   The `LicenseInstaller.exe` tool that comes with the NServiceBus install.
-   The [Install-License](/nservicebus/operations/management-using-powershell.md) PowerShell commandlet.
-   If your trial license has expired and you are running in debug mode, the endpoint shows you a dialog that enables you to install the license.

### NServiceBus 4.x versions prior to 4.5

When installed using the [Install-NServiceBusLicense](/nservicebus/operations/management-using-powershell.md) PowerShell commandlet and the `LicenseInstaller.exe` tool that comes with the NServiceBus install, in NServiceBus V4.0, the license file was stored under `HKLM\\Software\\NServiceBus\\{Major.Minor}\\License` and in version v4.3, this location was moved to `HKLM\\Software\\ParticularSoftware\\NServiceBus\\License`. 

In order to install the license file under HKCU (same location in version 3.3), please use the `-c` option on the `LicenseInstaller.exe`


## Using a sub-directory in your BIN directory

To have NServiceBus automatically pick up your License.xml file, place it in a subfolder named /License under your BIN folder.

## Using the app.config settings

As a developer you can specify the license in `app.config`:

-   Use the key `NServiceBus/LicensePath` to specify the path where NServiceBus looks for your license. For example:

```XML
<appSettings>
  <add key="NServiceBus/LicensePath" value="C:\NServiceBus\License\License.xml" />
</appSettings>
```
-   Use the key `NServiceBus/License` to transfer the actual HTML-encoded contents of your license. For example:

```XML
<appSettings>
  <add key="NServiceBus/License" value="&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;
license id=&quot;1222e1d1-2222-4a46-b1c6-943c442ca710&quot; expiration=&quot;2013-11-30T00:00:00.0000000
&quot; type=&quot;Standard&quot; LicenseType=&quot;Standard&quot; LicenseVersion=&quot;4.0
&quot; MaxMessageThroughputPerSecond=&quot;Max&quot; WorkerThreads=&quot;Max
&quot; AllowedNumberOfWorkerNodes=&quot;Max&quot;&gt;
. . .
&lt;/license&gt;" />  
</appSettings>
```

## Using the Fluent API

As a developer you can specify the license to use in your configuration code:

<!-- import License -->
